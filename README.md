# Swift-Games


Bunch of games I have worked on for the iOS store during the summer of 2017.

They are all uploaded into the iOS app store at the time of this creation.
Not sure if I want to pay another $99 to continue my membership.

***They are no longer up on the iOS store

However, you can open each project in Xcode and run them on the simulator.
